## 🖌️ Overview  

Stardock Fences is a practical desktop management solution that helps bring order to a cluttered workspace. Instead of piling dozens of icons across the screen, you can neatly group them into adjustable sections that stay exactly where you want them. This makes your desktop cleaner and easier to navigate.  

The program automatically organizes new shortcuts and files into their appropriate sections. Whether you want games in one area, office tools in another, or downloads in their own space, everything stays arranged without requiring manual cleanup.  

A handy feature is the ability to collapse or hide entire sections, letting you free up visual space whenever you need focus. With a quick double-click, you can switch between a minimalist view and a full desktop layout. This balance of visibility and simplicity is one of the app’s key strengths.  

Beyond organization, Fences lets you customize the look of your workspace. You can adjust transparency, choose colors, and fine-tune layouts to fit your personal style. Combined with smooth performance and lightweight operation, it’s designed to blend seamlessly into everyday use.  

For those who want even more control, the roll-up feature keeps groups accessible but tucked away until hovered over. This ensures the desktop stays uncluttered while still giving instant access to frequently used apps and files.  

The software is built with efficiency in mind, running quietly in the background without impacting system speed. It’s compatible with the latest versions of Windows and regularly updated to stay polished and reliable.  

By combining automation, customization, and simplicity, Stardock Fences provides a streamlined way to keep desktops functional and visually appealing. It turns scattered icons into a structured layout, making it easier to focus on work or simply enjoy a clean interface.
